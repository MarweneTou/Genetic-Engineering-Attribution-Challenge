# Genetic-Engineering-Attribution-Challenge
An algorithm that identifies the most likely lab-of-origin for genetically engineered DNA.
Applications for genetic engineering are rapidly diversifying. Researchers across the world are using powerful new techniques in synthetic biology to solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges in medicine, agriculture, manufacturing and more. At the same time, increasingly powerful genetically engineered systems could yield unintended consequences for people, food crops, livestock, and industry. These incredible advances in capability demand tools that support accountable innovation.

Genetic engineering attribution is the process of identifying the source of a genetically engineered piece of DNA. This ability ensures that scientists who have spent countless hours developing breakthrough technology get their due credit, intellectual property is protected, and responsible innovation is promoted. By connecting a genetically engineered system with its designers, society can examine the policies, processes, and decisions that led to its creation. As has been observed in other disciplines, reducing anonymity encourages more prudent behavior within scientific and entrepreneurial communities—without stifling innovation.

Development of attribution capabilities is critical for the maturation of genetic engineering as a field, protecting the significant benefits it promises society while promoting accountability, responsibility, and dialog.
